## Project Overview

This project is an Excel-based data analysis and dashboard created using a **dummy dataset**.
The main goal of this project was to practice **data cleaning, transformation, analysis, and visualization** using Excel tools like **Power Query, Pivot Tables, and Charts**.

The repository contains:

* An **Excel file** with cleaned data, analysis, and dashboard
* A **PNG image** of the final dashboard.

## Data Source

The dataset used in this project is a **dummy dataset downloaded for practice purposes**.
It does not represent real-world data.

## Data Cleaning & Transformation

All data preparation was done using **Power Query** in Excel. The steps include:

* Changing column data types
* Cleaning the data
* Removing unnecessary columns
* Transforming existing data
* Creating **four new calculated columns** based on business logic
* Loading the cleaned and transformed data back into Excel

## Data Analysis

After loading the cleaned data:

* Pivot Tables were created to analyze the data from different perspectives
* Each Pivot Table focuses on a specific analysis requirement

## Dashboard & Visualization

* Charts were created for each analysis using Pivot Tables
* These charts were combined into a single **interactive dashboard**
* A PNG image of the final dashboard is included in this repository

## Tools Used

* Microsoft Excel
* Power Query
* Pivot Tables
* Excel Charts

## Purpose of the Project

This project was created to:

* Improve Excel and Power Query skills
* Practice data cleaning and transformation
* Perform analysis using Pivot Tables
* Build a clear and simple dashboard for insights
