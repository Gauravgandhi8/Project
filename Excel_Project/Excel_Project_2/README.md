# 📊 Excel Data Analysis & Dashboard Project

## 🚀 Project Overview
This project demonstrates an **end-to-end data analysis workflow using Microsoft Excel & Power Query**.  
The goal was to combine multiple data sources, clean and transform the data, perform analysis using Pivot Tables, and finally build an interactive dashboard for insights and decision-making.

---

## 🗂️ Data Sources
- The project uses **4 different Excel sheets**
- Each sheet contains **important and related columns**
- All sheets are **merged using Power Query** by creating relationships between common columns

---

## 🔧 Data Transformation (Power Query)
The following steps were performed in **Power Query**:

- ✅ Merged four sheets into a single structured dataset  
- ✅ Created relationships between key columns  
- ✅ Removed unnecessary columns
